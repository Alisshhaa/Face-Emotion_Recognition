# Face-Emotion_Recognition
The Face Emotion Recognition System is a machine learning-based application designed to detect and classify human emotions from facial expressions in real time. It uses computer vision techniques such as OpenCV for face detection and a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on facial expression datasets like FER-2013. The system can accurately identify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, and fearful. It captures input from a webcam or image and processes facial features to predict the emotional state. This project has practical applications in human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and customer experience analysis.
